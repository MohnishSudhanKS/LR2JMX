CHANGES
    Revision history for Perl extension XML::Tidy:

    - 1.20 H79M9hU8 Sun Jul 9 09:43:30:08 -0500 2017
      * removed broken Build.PL to resolve
      <HTTPS://RT.CPAN.Org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122406>. (Thank you,
      Slaven.)

    - 1.18 H78M5qm1 Sat Jul 8 05:52:48:01 -0500 2017
      * fixed new() to check file or xml to detect standalone in
      declaration, from <HTTPS://RT.CPAN.Org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122389>
      (Thanks Alex!)

      * traced tidy() memory leak from
      <HTTPS://RT.CPAN.Org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120296> (Thanks Jozef!)
      which seems to come from every XPath->findnodes() call

      * aligned synopsis comments

      * updated write() to use output encoding UTF-8 since that's what
      almost all XML should rely on (with thanks to RJBS for teaching me
      much from his great talk at <HTTPS://YouTube.Com/watch?v=TmTeXcEixEg>)

      * collapsed trailing curly braces on code blocks

      * added croak for any failed file open attempt

    - 1.16 G6LM4EST Tue Jun 21 04:14:28:29 -0500 2016
      * stopped using my old fragile package generation and manually updated
      all distribution files (though Dist::Zilla should let me generate much
      again)

      * updated license to GPLv3+

      * fixed 00pod.t and 01podc.t to eval the Test modules from issue and
      patch: <HTTPS://RT.CPAN.Org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=85592> (Thanks
      again MichielB.)

      * replaced all old '&&' with 'and' in POD

    - 1.14 G6JMERCY Sun Jun 19 14:27:12:34 -0500 2016
      * separated old PT from VERSION to fix non-numeric issue:
      <HTTPS://RT.CPAN.Org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=56073> (Thanks to
      Slaven.)

      * removed Unicode from POD but added encoding utf8 anyway to pass
      tests and resolve issues:
      <HTTPS://RT.CPAN.Org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=92434> and
      <HTTPS://RT.CPAN.Org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=85592> (Thanks to
      Sudhanshu and MichielB.)

    - 1.12.B55J2qn Thu May 5 19:02:52:49 2011

      * fixed off-by-one error when new gets a readable (non-newline)
      filename (that's not "filename" without a pre-'filename' param) to
      resolve: <HTTPS://RT.CPAN.Org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65151> (Thanks,
      Simone.)

    - 1.6.A7RJKwl Tue Jul 27 19:20:58:47 2010
